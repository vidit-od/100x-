# Dumb Todolist

## Overview

"Dumb Todolist" is a simple todo list application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is called "dumb" because it utilizes DOM properties directly to create, manipulate, and update elements in the browser, without using any modern frameworks or libraries.

## Features

- Add new tasks to the todo list.

## Limitations

- Currently, the app only supports adding new tasks to the todo list. Features such as removing and updating tasks have not yet been implemented.

## Purpose

The purpose of the "Dumb Todolist" project is to demonstrate the importance of using modern JavaScript frameworks like React for building dynamic web applications. By showing the manual DOM manipulation approach, the project highlights the complexities and limitations of managing state and handling user interactions without the assistance of a framework.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Use the provided input field to add new tasks to the list.

## File Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the todo list and also the Js logic.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file containing styles for the todo list.
