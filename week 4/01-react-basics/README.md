# React Project README

Welcome to our React project! This repository serves as a starting point for mastering React syntax and setting up React projects using Vite. Here, we'll create a basic todo list application using React.

## Getting Started

To set up the project and start coding, follow these simple steps:

1. **Install Vite**: First, install Vite globally using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install -g create-vite
   ```

2. **Create Project**: Use Vite to create a new React project:
   ```bash
   create-vite@latest
   ```

3. **Navigate and Install Dependencies**: Move into your project directory and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd your-project-directory
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start Development Server**: Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

You're now ready to dive into React development!

## Project Overview

Our goal is to build a todo list application similar to the one found in './00-practice/dumb-todo', but with React. Users will input task descriptions, and the application will dynamically create a todo list based on their input.

## Understanding State in React

React relies on state variables and state functions to manage dynamic content within components. The syntax for using state in React is straightforward:

```jsx
const [stateVariable, setStateFunction] = useState('initialValue');
```

When a state variable changes, React automatically invokes the corresponding state function. This function contains logic for updating the frontend DOM with added, removed, or updated content.

## JSX: Combining JavaScript and HTML

JSX is a powerful feature of React that allows developers to blend JavaScript and HTML syntax seamlessly. It simplifies the creation and manipulation of DOM elements by enabling the use of HTML-like code directly within JavaScript files.

## Conclusion

Our React project offers a hands-on experience for learning React syntax, state management, and JSX. By following the steps outlined above and exploring the codebase, you'll gain a solid understanding of React fundamentals, empowering you to build more complex and dynamic applications confidently.
